What it can do:
- Create an Array and perform functions as a datatype List
- Runs through a driver program testing all the list functions
- Finish linked list and perform functions as a datatype List

Left to do:
- Tackle optional functions (I will do that on my own time, and not submit)

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to lists directory
- run ```go build lists.go```
- remove other executable ```rm lists```
- run ```.\lists.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run lists.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
